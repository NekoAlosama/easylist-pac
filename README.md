# easylist-pac (NekoAlosama's mod)
Use the following URL for proxy autoconfig: https://gitcdn.xyz/repo/NekoAlosama/easylist-pac/master/proxy.pac


This modification uses EasyList, Adguard's English, Adguard's Mobile, and Adguard's DNS filters to create the .pac file. Hopefully, [`-w` will get fixed and I will be able to use sliding window training.](https://github.com/essandess/easylist-pac-privoxy/issues/16)


## Original README.md
...is seen [here.](https://github.com/essandess/easylist-pac-privoxy/blob/master/README.md)


Below is a PSA by the original creator, essandess, that I will keep here. This is also seen at the bottom of the original README.md.


## Public Service Announcement 

This proxy.pac is configured to block all known tracker and adware content at the network level. Many websites now offer an additional way to block ads: subscribe to their content. Security and privacy will always necessitate ad blocking, but now that this software has become mainstream with mainstream effects, ad blocker users must consider the [potential impact](http://arstechnica.com/business/2010/03/why-ad-blocking-is-devastating-to-the-sites-you-love/) of ad blocking on the writers and publications that are important to them. Personally, two publications that I gladly pay for, especially for their important US political and other coverage, are the *[New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com)* and *[The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com)*. I encourage all users to subscribe to their own preferred publications and writers.
